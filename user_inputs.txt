Question 1: The data represents Amazon customer reviews for electronics products with ratings, written feedback, and product details.
Question 2: The data shows Amazon customer reviews with ratings, titles, and review text for different products.
Question 3: This data is a bit more organized
Question 4: More readable data
Question 5: The data shows Amazon customer reviews with ratings, titles, and review text for different products.
Question 6: A good histogram!
Question 7: Another type of histogram.....

In the first stage, the project proved to be very challenging and ambiguous.
I was not familiar with the data, nor did I know the role of each step in the process. 
Too many new ideas were introduced at the start, and I found myself lost among them.

To overcome these challenges, I broke down my project into smaller parts and then started learning about each part one by one. 
As and when any uncertainties came up, I referred to various online sources and gained basic knowledge about pandas. 
I was able to learn how to analyze my data, check my columns, and use basic conditional filtering.

This experience proved that in the world of real-world data, 
there are always some errors or some values that are missing. It also proved that learning is not an overnight process, 
and it is okay to learn at one's own pace. By the end of this experience, 
I was familiarized not only with pandas, but also with working in Jupyter Notebook, and I was able to learn a lot by doing, not by reading.
